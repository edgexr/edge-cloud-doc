## vSphere Deployment Where Operator Provides an Account on Their Existing vSphere to MobiledgeX

For this model, the operator provides an account to MobiledgeX in their existing VMware vSphere with the suitably configured UE Wireless and external internet networks. The operator remains in management of the vSphere, vCenter and its associated shared storage, external networking and switch configurations. MobiledgeX is provided with user-level access to vSphere, permissions to create the required vSphere clusters via vCenter, desired virtual machines, and networks in the MobiledgeX assigned account. MobiledgeX designs the VMware tenant Networking design and onboards the cloudlets. Mobiledgex also maintains the cloudlets and supports Edge operations.
