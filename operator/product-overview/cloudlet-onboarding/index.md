MobiledgeXâ€™s Cloudlet Manager Plugin aggregates edge infrastructure across Mobile Network Operator locations and supports multiple IaaS types. Our Cloudlet Manager Plugin lowers the barrier of entry and makes it easy for Telcos to leverage their existing IaaS network edge infrastructure and offer it as an aggregated, federated cloud resource for developers. The flexibility also enables different infrastructure types, thereby avoiding vendor lock-in, allowing a Telco edge cloud to be independent of the underlying infrastructure to provide a true multi-cloud, multi-vendor, and multi-access edge cloud solution.
