## vCD Deployment Where Operator Provides a Tenant on Their Existing vCD to MobiledgeX

For this model, the Operator provides a tenant account to MobiledgeX in their existing vCD Virtualization Stack with the suitably configured UE Wireless and external internet networks. The operator remains in management of the vCD and its associated external networking and switch configurations. MobiledgeX is provided with user-level access to vCD, permissions to create the desired virtual machines, vAPP templates, and networks in the MobiledgeX assigned vCD account. MobiledgeX designs the vCD tenant Networking design and on-boards the cloudlets. Mobiledgex also maintains the cloudlets and supports Edge operations.
