<h5>Sendinblue</h5>

Sendinblue allows Us to analyze the visitors to the Website, and how We may most appropriately deliver more information to them about the Services. The processes and mechanisms Sendinblue uses to provide their analytics and services are solely governed by their respective privacy policy, and not MobiledgeX’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The Website also uses Sendinblue to collect the data you submit to us through filling in forms on the Website, which is combined with the tracking information.</p>
