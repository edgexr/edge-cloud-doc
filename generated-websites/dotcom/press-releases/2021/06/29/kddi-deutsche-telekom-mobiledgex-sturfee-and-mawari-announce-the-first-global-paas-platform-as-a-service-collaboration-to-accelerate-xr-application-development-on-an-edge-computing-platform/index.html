                        <p>BARCELONA, Spain, June 29, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MOBILE WORLD CONGRESS -- KDDI Corporation (headquartered in Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan; Makoto Takahashi, President and CEO; hereinafter “KDDI”), Deutsche Telekom AG (headquartered in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany; Timotheus Höttges, CEO; hereinafter “Deutsche Telekom”), MobiledgeX, Inc. (headquartered in California, U.S.A.; Jason Hoffman, CEO; hereinafter referred to as “MobiledgeX”), Sturfee, Inc. (headquartered in California, U.S.A.; Anil Cheriyadat, CEO; hereinafter referred to as “Sturfee”), and Mawari, Inc. (headquartered in Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, Japan; Luis Oscar Ramirez Solorzano, CEO; hereinafter referred to as &quot;Mawari&quot;) have jointly developed a proof of concept (PoC) in order to realize the world&#039;s first (Note.1) PaaS (Platform as a Service) for XR applications development provided as a common platform on edge computing platforms provided by each telecom operator. This PoC will be launched in June 2021 in alignment with the GSMA Telco Edge Cloud (TEC) initiative (Note.2 &amp; Note.3).<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>The Challenge: Deploying Low Latency Applications on Multiple Operator Edge Networks</strong><br>Edge network platforms are intended to support AR / VR, automatic driving, robotics, and other applications that take advantage of the low latency of 5G. Next generation interactive media apps (XR) require closer proximity to supporting APIs and SDKs in their backend code, to deliver the quality of experience and scale that is required. This is because media is generated from all participants’ locations and cameras in real time and any lack of synchronization could produce a poor user experience. There is a growing need among application developers for consistent APIs and cloud services to be deployed within the edge networks to support these next generation applications in an easy and consistent way.</p><p>However, for developers who want to release their applications globally, this can lead to longer development times and higher operating costs. This is because edge networks are provided by each telecom operator, so it is necessary to individually deploy, test, and operate middleware such as APIs for each operator network in each country.</p><p>For the telecom operator, the challenge is speed, scale, and collaboration. Today, telecom operators cannot benefit from each other&#039;s complementary market development, especially in the space of discovering new “in-network” services that will be required to power the next generation of apps and solutions.</p><p><strong>The Solution: PoC Overview</strong><br>In this PoC, KDDI and Deutsche Telekom will collaborate with Mawari, MobiledgeX, and Sturfee to solve the challenges of efficiently delivering applications on a global scale.</p><p>KDDI and Deutsche Telekom will collaborate with Mawari, MobiledgeX, and Sturfee to make a Visual Positioning Service (VPS) -- provided by KDDI&#039;s development partner Sturfee, which is compatible with the MobiledgeX Edge-Cloud platform -- and deploy it as a PaaS to KDDI and Deutsche Telekom&#039;s edge network.<br>In addition, the SDK provided by PaaS will be embedded into the AR app on a smartphone, and a 3D virtual human application called &quot;coh&quot; will be distributed from KDDI and Deutsche Telekom to the smartphone XR app. &quot;coh&quot; is created and provided by KDDI&#039;s creative team &quot;au Vision Studio”.</p><p>KDDI and Deutsche Telekom will demonstrate that this PoC can be used to efficiently develop low-latency XR applications that are running on smartphones, smart glasses, and other XR devices.</p><p>A photo accompanying this announcement is available at: </p><p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/5ead83ff-f5c9-4281-b899-15ea5b209722">https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/5ead83ff-f5c9-4281-b899-15ea5b209722</a></p><p><strong>Detail: Key Steps in the PoC Process</strong></p><ol start="1"><li><p>For the global deployment of XR applications, KDDI and Deutsche Telekom will build a platform that can efficiently deploy XR applications by leveraging the MobiledgeX Edge-Cloud 3.0 platform that integrates and manages access to telecom operators in each country and enables applications to be easily deployed to each operator network.</p></li><li><p>Using the platform built by KDDI and Deutsche Telekom, VPS, a spatial recognition technology of Sturfee and XR content streaming technology provided by Mawari will be deployed to the edge networks of both companies.</p></li><li><p>Will also develop an API/SDK as PaaS to enable collaboration between Sturfee’s VPS and Mawari’s XR streaming technology.</p></li><li><p>Will demonstrate that KDDI&#039;s Virtual human “coh”, planned and developed by KDDI&#039;s creative team &quot;au VISION STUDIO&quot; (Partner: Aww Inc.), is streamed by leveraging Sturfee’s VPS and Mawari’s XR streaming technology from the MobiledgeX powered edge cloud in both Japan and Germany.</p></li><li><p>To make it easier for application developers and content creators to deploy XR content globally, the API/SDK developed in this PoC will be made available on the &quot;au VISION STUDIO&quot; project introduction website in October 2021.<br></p></li></ol><p>The five companies are currently participating in the TEC Trial promoted by GSMA and aim to realize PaaS through this PoC to solve customer issues and create global business opportunities.</p><p>A photo accompanying this announcement is available at:  <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/c979f1e3-3994-40a5-aef8-f1454f54023a">https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/c979f1e3-3994-40a5-aef8-f1454f54023a</a></p><p><strong>For the future:</strong><br>KDDI will continue to develop use cases that utilize edge networks in preparation for the commercial deployment of 5G SA, as well as promote the realization of a platform that enables the provision of edge-enabled applications of the same quality anywhere in the world via any telecom operator&#039;s network.</p><p>The role of each company:<br></p><p><strong>KDDI:</strong><br>Overall promotion of this PoC, provision of edge network and implementation of this PoC</p><p><strong>Deutsche Telekom:<br></strong>Provision of edge network and implementation of this PoC</p><p><strong>MobiledgeX:<br></strong>Providing 5G application distribution independent of underlying operator cloud choices, both public and private, and with common interfaces across telecom operators</p><p><strong>Sturfee:<br></strong>Providing VPS technology as part of edge network service for real-time spatial understanding of surroundings utilizing edge networks and deployment of VPS to KDDI’s and Deutsche Telekom’s edge network using MobiledgeX technology</p><p><strong>Mawari:<br></strong>Deployment of XR Streaming Solution for KDDI&#039;s &quot;Virtual Human&quot;
