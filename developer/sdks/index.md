One of the most powerful solutions to application deployment we offer is through the use of our SDKs. While our APIs are responsible for finding the closest application instance based on a deviceâ€™s cellular connection and geo-location, our SDKs take it one step further by building on top of our APIs to make it even easier to find the closest application instance. Further, with our SDKs, you can monitor usage statistics for applications, providing a well-rounded solution for deployed applications.
