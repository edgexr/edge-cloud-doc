Tools and Resources that developers may use in order to make it easier to utilize the MobiledgeX platform.

While we provide an easy way to use our edge-cloud console for your application needs, you can also use our command-line tool to interface with our console and perform things like viewing metrics, set up alerts, monitor usage, and much more. We also provide a simple tool you can use to test MobiledgeX locally and see how our services deploy applications onto the cloudlet with zero impact on your existing network infrastructure.
