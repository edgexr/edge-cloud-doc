Cloudlet Pools are collections of [cloudlets](/deployments/deployment-workflow/cloudlets) that are defined on a per-regional basis and made private by operators. To gain access to the cloudlets in a Cloudlet Pool, an operator must first invite your developer organization to that Cloudlet Pool. Once an operator invites you to their Cloudlet Pool, you will see an invitation to join that Cloudlet Pool. If you choose to accept the invitation, your organization will now have the ability to deploy cluster instances and application instances on that cloudlet.

Only developer Managers of your [organization](/deployments/accounts/org-users) will be able to accept or withdraw from a Cloudlet Pool.

**Note:** Operators can view developersâ€™ logs and events from the [monitoring ](https://operators.mobiledgex.com/product-overview/operator-guides/debugging/operator-monitoring-and-metrics/) dashboard if they are part of the Cloudlet Pool.
