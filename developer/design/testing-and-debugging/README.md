Debugging can be considered a time-consuming and often complex process to attempt to correct errors within a system or software. The MobiledgeX Platformâ€™s debugging strategies include an alert manager, health checks, and a quick way to retrieve and store metrics, which will help you identify, analyze, and resolve defects and errors. Use these tools to monitor the performance of your system and counteract irregularities. Receive alerts based on your predefined criteria, manage any failover of applications using our command-line tool, and even write your own scripts to move metrics of interest into your own database.
