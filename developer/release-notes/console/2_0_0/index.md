---

With the release of [Edge-Cloud R2.0](https://mobiledgex.com/product), a number of capabilities such as the management, operations and monitoring of application deployments and resources are available through an easy-to-use [Edge-Cloud Console](https://console.mobiledgex.net/site1?pg=0). As a Developer, you can use the console to manage your software deployment across all operator’s distributed edge infrastructure, further simplifying the deployment of enterprise resources and applications. Operators, on the other hand,  can use the [Edge-Cloud Console](https://console.mobiledgex.net/site1?pg=0) to monitor the usage of the Operator-owned Cloudlets. Both Developers and Operators can monitor and manage most of their operations through a single pane of glass.

For a comprehensive list of features and capabilities, refer to our recent announcement of [Edge-Cloud 2.0](https://mobiledgex.com/product). Documentation and Resources can be found on our [Developer Portal](https://developers.mobiledgex.com/), where we continuously publish new documentation and resources to help you realize the potential of our solutions and offerings.

The table below lists specific features added to our [Edge-Cloud Console](https://console.mobiledgex.net/site1?pg=0).

## New Features on Edge-Cloud Console

| Title                                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Alert Framework                                                   | Currently a beta feature, MobiledgeX’s Platform provides an AlertManager that serves as the global component responsible for distributing alerts to application owners and cloudlet operators. Alarms are consolidated at the regional level, where each regional controller receives alarms. Based on the user configuration, an alert receiver can be created, and depending on user preference; an alert notification is sent via email or Slack to the user for mitigation. |
| Alert Receivers                                                   | A new Alert Receivers sub-menu is added to simplify the creation of alert receivers. Users can set up alert receivers for application instances, clusters, and cloudlets.Additionally, AlertReceiver APIs have been added through the mcctl utility program to provide users flexibility to integrate with their existing monitoring systems: `api/v1/auth/alertreceiver/create`, `api/v1/auth/alertreceiver/delete`, `api/v1/auth/alertreceiver/show`                          | Monitoring | A more simplified interface is implemented to help users continue to filter and display analytics and data for clusters, application instances, and cloudlets, where filtering can be done by App Inst, Cluster Inst, Cloudlet, and Org. Audit, Event, and Usage detailed logs can all be viewed through the Monitoring page by selecting a drop-down icon.The details of all Alerts generated can also be viewed from this page.Audit logs: Log user activities such as logging, creating applications, deleting users, creating policies, etc. Event logs: These are system-generated events and can include services such as auto-provision policy, auto-scaling, application instance, or HA, where our platform will trigger events based on these user policies. Usage Logs: These logs are generated to view the status (online or offline) of clusters, application instances status, or Cloudlets, and maintenance status.  |
| App event log displayed for an app instance (Developer interface) | On the Monitoring page, we now display event logs for application instances deployed via the auto-provision policy for reservable cluster instances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Auto-Provision Policy Undeploy (Developer interface)              | We now provide the ability to undeploy application instances based on the threshold and value set for the Undeploy Request Count and Undeploy Interval Count(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Cloudlet selection for HA (Operator interface)                    | Previously for HA-based cloudlets, two cloudlets in the same location would only allow one cloudlet to be utilized while the other stayed idle. Now, with the implementation of randomized cloudlet selection, both cloudlets can be utilized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Cloudlet Events (Operator interface)                              | Alerts and events are now generated for cloudlets that are down, in the process of upgrading, or are in maintenance mode. These events can be viewed through the Monitoring page. Operators can set up alert receivers to receive an alert notification when these alarms are triggered.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Bot Protection                                                    | With the implementation of CAPTCHA, users are now presented with a CAPTCHA checkbox during the registration process. If the system detects suspicious behavior, further validation will be required through an image recognition task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)                                   | Users can optionally set this up during account registration for an added layer of security, where an additional step of verification is required during sign-in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Strong Passwords                                                  | Passwords now must meet all password requirements and guidelines to help thwart possible brute force attacks. In addition to the password requirements, password strength must also meet all scoring requirements provided by MobiledgeX through an entropy scoring system for passwords to be considered strong.                                                                                                                                                               |

| Regional controller                                                      | For scalability, privacy, and the operational ease of managing your Organization, all  cloudlets are part of a controller, and are organized by regions. As a developer, you can deploy your application instance to multiple cloudlets within the same Operator and region. As an Operator, you can deploy multiple cloudlets with the same region. Each region has its own controller along with its own database. Each database contains data, such as Cloudlets, Flavors, ClusterInstance, Apps, that exist within that region. The Master Controller directly communicates with each regional controller, and all requests made by the console passes through the Master Controller. The Master Controller will determine which regional controller to communicate with when you select an available Region from the pull-down list.  |

| Ability to add security group during CreateAppInst                       | During the CreateAppInst process, Developers can configure security groups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Upgrade App and App Instances                                            | Developers can update an application or application instance by specifying a revision field, which identifies the specific revision number. Furthermore, you can update application instances independently of the applications, maintaining a mix of current existing revisions. Simultaneously upgrading multiple instances of applications and application instances is also supported. However, developers are responsible for maintaining the history of their upgrades or revisions; MobiledgeX does not track or maintain older versions of application and application instances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Dedicated security group per cluster                                     | Dedicated clusters are assigned to each security group, and restricted traffic occurs for groups that are not part of the default group. You can also create multiple clusters at once. Furthermore, you can have a dedicated or shared Root-LB balancer. When you create a cluster, we automatically create a shared Root-LB balancer. If flagged as shared, Kubernetes cluster will use that shared Root-LB balancer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
