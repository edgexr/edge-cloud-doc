MobiledgeX Computer Vision is an open-source project hosted on our MobiledgeX Samples repository that allows you to integrate services like Face/Object/Pose Detection into your application with our MobiledgeX SDKs and Computer Vision REST APIs. This allows developers to focus on developing their client applications without worrying about deployments on the Edge.
