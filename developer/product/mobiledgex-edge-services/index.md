## MobiledgeX Computer Vision (beta)

The MobiledgeX [Computer Vision Service](/developer/services/computer-vision/index.md) offers a simple REST API, which processes input image data, and runs specific processing. The service offers the following Computer Vision processing capabilities:

- **Face Detection:** The server will detect all faces within the image and then return back meta-data representing the rectangular coordinates of the face within the image.
- **Face Recognition:** The server will recognize a face within the frame, based on the training data set, and then return the coordinate, name, and confidence of the prediction.
- **Object Detection:** With either CPU or GPU, the server will detect and recognize objects based on the model used and then return the coordinates, name, and confidence, per object.
- **Pose Detection:** Using the GPU, the server will detect the skeletal pose of a human within the frame and then return the 2D coordinates of each joint.

## MobiledgeX Edge Multiplay (beta)

The MobiledgeX [Edge Multiplay](/developer/services/unity-edgemultiplay/index.md) Service is a Game Server solution that syncs messages and data across connected devices. With our provided solution built in Unity, you can quickly start building a Multiplayer game that works on the Edge.
