## What is Mobile Network Edge Computing?

The Mobile Network Edge is a distributed network of data centers which telecommunication operators around the world manage. A unique feature of these Mobile Network Edge data centers, what we refer to as [cloudlets](/deployments/deployment-workflow/cloudlets), is that they are located at cellular tower networks. As a result, application data can be routed on a 4G or 5G cellular connection from a **device**, such as a smart phone, through the **cell tower**, directly to your **application server** in the data center.

This results in the two primary benefits compared to traditional cloud computing:

- Lower network latency
- Lower network jitter

To enable developers to deploy their applications onto the Mobile Network Edge, MobiledgeX provides a cloudlet agnostic platform, where you can deploy &amp; scale your server application across various Mobile Networks.
